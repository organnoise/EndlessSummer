Endless Summer is a non-linear video piece that keeps the main characters of American Pie in a state of partying-limbo ad infinitum. This project was originally built in openFrameworks for an installation and ported into a website after the show ended.

## Web

Simplified so no more gulp, npm, etc.

## openFrameworks

This project requires the ofxHapPlayer addon. Main video file not on github due to size, but it should be placed in ```bin/data/videos```.
